## 0.1 Purpose of this Syllabus

This syllabus forms the basis for the International Software Testing Qualification Board forAgileTestLeadership at Scaleat theAdvancedLevel.The ISTQB®providesthis syllabusas follows:

  1. To Member Boards, to translate into their local language and to accredit training providers. Member Boards may adapt the syllabus to their particular language needs and modify the references and other stuff in the syllabus to adapt to their local publications.
  2. To certification bodies, to derive examination questions in their local language adapted to thelearning objectives for this syllabus.
  3. To training providers, to produce courseware and determine appropriate teaching methods.
  4. To certification candidates, to prepare for the certification exam (either as part of a trainingcourse or independently).
  5. To the international software and systems engineering community, to advance the professionof software and systems testing, and as a basis for books and articles.

## 0.2 TheAgileTest Leadership at Scale Certification

The ISTQB® Agile Test Leadership at Scale (CTAL-ATLaS) certification focuses on how to organize and improve quality and testing across multiple teams in an agile organization. It also covers how to approach quality and testing at a strategic level in order to achieve higher business agility in an organization.

TheAdvanced LevelAgileTest Leadership at Scale (ATLaS) qualification is aimed at people whowork in an organization that is pursuing agility at scale or business agility and already have a basic understanding of agile and agile testing.

This includes people in roles such as test manager, head of testing, quality coach, test analyst,technical test analyst, test automation engineer, quality engineer, quality assurance, member of anagile team, member of a leader group of multiple agile teams, ITdirector, project manager, releasetrain engineer, scrum master, product owner, and management consultant.

### 0.2.1 Connectionto Other Certifications in the ISTQB®Scheme

TheAdvanced LevelAgileTest Leadership at Scale builds on the qualifications in Foundation LevelCertified Tester and Foundation LevelAgileTester. Certified Tester provides the basic knowledge andcompetencies in software testing.Agile Tester expands on Certified Tester and explains how testing inan agile team is performed.

AsAgileTest Leadership at Scale focuses on the organizational level, it supplements theAdvancedLevelAgileTechnical Tester focusing on technical practices. It also supplementsAdvanced LevelTestManagement, which focuses on projects and not on organizational aspects. In addition,Advanced LevelTest Management covers traditional approaches and hybrid approaches.

## Examinable Learning Objectives and Cognitive Level of Knowledge

Learning objectives (LOs) support the business outcomes and are used to create theAdvanced Level AgileTest Leadership at Scale exams.

In general, all contents of this syllabus are examinable at a K1 level, except for the Introduction and Appendices.That is, the candidate may be asked to recognize, remember, or recall a keyword or

concept mentioned in any of the chapters.The specific LOs levels are shown at the beginning of each chapter, and classified as follows:

- K1: Remember
- K2: Understand
- K3:Apply
- K4:Analyze

Further details about cognitive level of knowledge are given in [**Appendix A**](#_bookmark18).

All terms listed as keywords just below chapter headings shall be remembered (K1), even if not explicitly mentioned in the learning objectives.

## Hands-On Objectives

LOs and hands-on objectives (HOs) focus on practical skills and competencies. However, HOs arenot examined by the multiple-choice exam questions. It is expected that HOs are covered either as part of an accredited training or as self-study.

The specific HOs levels are shown at the beginning of each chapter, and classified as follows:

- H0:This can include a live demo of an exercise or recorded video. Since this is not performed by the trainee, it is not strictly an exercise.
- H1: Guided exercise.The trainees follow a sequence of steps performed by the trainer.
- H2: Exercise with hints.The trainee is given an exercise with relevant hints to enable the exercise to be solved within the given timeframe.
- H3: Unguided exercises without hints.

Training material owners and people who self-study can find additional guidance on how to includepractical elements to fulfill HOs in theATLaSAccreditation Guidelines.

## TheAdvanced LevelAgileTest Leadership at Scale Certification Exam

TheAgileTest Leadership at Scale certification is created incrementally. Each increment is madeavailable on the ISTQB_®_websiteso the contentscan be usedfor training andlearning. However,the certification exam will be released once the release increments correspond to a two-day training course.Therefore, the detailed description of the certification exam will be added with the last increment.

TheAdvanced LevelAgileTest Leadership at Scale Certificate exam will be based on this syllabusand theAdvanced LevelAgileTest Leadership at Scale body of knowledge (BOK).Answers to examquestions may require the use of material based on more than one section of this syllabus and body of knowledge. Standards and books are included as references, but their content is not examinable, beyond what is summarized in the syllabus or body of knowledge from such standards and books.

Entry Requirement Note:The ISTQB_®_FoundationLevel certificateshall be obtained before taking theAdvanced LevelAgileTest Leadership at Scale certification exam. Contact your local member board for more details.

## Accreditation

An ISTQB_®_Member Boardor its agentmay accredit trainingproviders whosecourse materialfollows this syllabus and the body of knowledge.Training providers should obtain accreditationguidelines from the Member Board or its agent that performs the accreditation.An accredited course is recognized as conforming to this syllabus and the body of knowledge, and is allowed to have an ISTQB_®_examaspart ofthecourse.

Training providers are encouraged to use the contents of this certification in other contexts and tobuild the training material incrementally. Feedback from such activities will be considered before thefull certification is released.

The accreditation guidelines forAdvanced LevelAgileTest Leadership at Scale follow the generalAccreditation Guidelines published by the Processes Management and Compliance Working Group.

## Levelof Detail

The level of detail in this syllabus allows internationally consistent courses and exams. In order to achieve this goal, the syllabus consists of:

- _General_ _instructional__objectives_describing the intention of theAdvanced LevelAgileTestLeadership at Scale Level
- _A __list__ of_ _keywords_ that students must be able to recall
- LOs for each knowledge area, describing the cognitive learning outcome to be achieved
- Adescription of the key concepts, including references to sources such as accepted literature or standards

The syllabus content is not a description of the entire knowledge area of testing in agile organizations; it reflects the level of detail to be covered inAdvanced LevelAgileTest Leadership at Scale trainingcourses.

## How this Syllabus is Organized

There are fivechapters with examinable content.The top-level heading for eachchapter specifies the time for the chapter; timing is not provided below chapter level_._ For accredited training courses the five chapters require a minimum of 11.5 hours of instruction divided over at least two days.The five chapters are:

- Chapter 1: 60 minutes, QualityAssistance
- Chapter 2: 120 minutes, Improve Quality and Flow in a Value-Driven Organization
- Chapter 3: 150 minutes, Continuous Improvement of Quality and Testing
- Chapter 4: 165 minutes,OrganizationalTest Strategy in a Value-Driven Organization
- Chapter 5: 195 minutes,Test Process in a Value-Driven Organization

## Business Context


Organizations strive to improve their business agility to provide valuable products and services in a changing world.Akey way to improve business agility is to transform the culture and mindset by using differentprinciples,frameworks, disciplines,andmethodologies suchasagile, lean,andDevOps, which we here cover with the term "business agility." One common principle in these frameworks anddisciplines is the focus on delivering value with the quality that customers demand, i.e., customer- focused.Therefore, the term value-driven is used to describe organizations that strive to achieve business agility regardless of their various ways of working.

Agile started as a way to improve how software was delivered iteratively. It focused on a smalldelivery team that could release software in shorter iterations than the traditional software development lifecycles.As the popularity of the agile methods grew, it became apparent that attimes there was a need for several delivery teams to collaborate in order to develop larger and more complex systems (also called a team of agile teams).Therefore, new frameworks were created in order to scale agile from individual

agile delivery teams to multiple delivery teams contributing to the value of the solution. Delivery teams oftenconsistof peoplefrom differentorganizations thatwork togetherto providethe overallsolution. This move from focusing on individual delivery teams to multiple teams is called "agile at scale" or "scaled agile."This also requires that testing approaches are scaled.

Scaling agile is not necessarily the same as business agility, which includes the entire enterprise, butin order to achieve business agility an organization could benefit from adopting agile at scale.

With business agility there is an even greater need for accelerated quality.This is not achievable if allresponsibility for quality remains in the individual teams or specific roles such as testers.Therefore, test management moves to quality management and organizations need to adopt quality assistance across the organization as well as within delivery teams.This changes the role of quality assurance and test professionals to be closer to agile test leadership and to fostering a quality culture and mindset.

## Business Outcome

The business outcome (BO) describes the benefit that a certified person should be able to deliver using the knowledge and competencies covered in the syllabus.The knowledge and competencies are described in the LOs for each chapter.

### BO 1 Foster a Value-Driven Quality Mindset and Culture

Aperson who has gained the qualifications in this syllabus can build and sustain a quality and testing culture in a value-driven organization or in an organization transitioning to a value-driven culture.

An example of a measurable key result for the business outcome is:

- Provide quality assistance to **x** colleagues, who do not have a background in testing or other quality management activities

(replace x with your own target).

### BO 2 Co-create and implement an organizational test strategy that develops quality and testing capabilities

In a value-driven organization, it is still crucial to have a strategy for building the required quality and testing capabilities to deliver customer and business value.

Examples of measurable key results for the business outcome are:

- A continuous reduction in lead time for Minimum Viable Products (MVP) or Minimum Marketable Features (MMF)
- time for Minimum Viable Products (MVP) or Minimum Marketable Features (MMF)
- x % improvement in reaching business benefits
- x % reduction in production incidents or customer complaints (a customer is whoever consumes your product or service)
- x% increase in quality improvement experiments inspired by the organizational test strategy
- x% increase in improvement feedback

### BO3 Continuously improve test processes addressing challenges in the context of scaled agile product development
