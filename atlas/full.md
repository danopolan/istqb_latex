## 0.1 Purpose of this Syllabus
This syllabus forms the basis for the International Software Testing Qualification Board for Agile Test Leadership at Scale at the Advanced Level. The ISTQB® provides this syllabus as follows:

#. To Member Boards, to translate into their local language and to accredit training providers. Member Boards may adapt the syllabus to their particular language needs and modify the references to adapt to their local publications.
#. To certification bodies, to derive examination questions in their local language adapted to the learning objectives for this syllabus.
#. To training providers, to produce courseware and determine appropriate teaching methods.
#. To certification candidates, to prepare for the certification exam (either as part of a training course or independently).
#. To the international software and systems engineering community, to advance the profession of software and systems testing, and as a basis for books and articles.

## 0.2 The Agile Test Leadership at Scale Certification

The ISTQB® Agile Test Leadership at Scale (CTAL-ATLaS) certification focuses on how to organize and improve quality and testing across multiple teams in an agile organization. It also covers how to approach quality and testing at a strategic level in order to achieve higher business agility in an organization.

The Advanced Level Agile Test Leadership at Scale (ATLaS) qualification is aimed at people who work in an organization that is pursuing agility at scale or business agility and already have a basic understanding of agile and agile testing.

This includes people in roles such as test manager, head of testing, quality coach, test analyst, technical test analyst, test automation engineer, quality engineer, quality assurance, member of an agile team, member of a leader group of multiple agile teams, IT director, project manager, release train engineer, scrum master, product owner, and management consultant.

### 0.2.1 Connection to Other Certifications in the ISTQB® Scheme
The Advanced Level Agile Test Leadership at Scale builds on the qualifications in Foundation Level Certified Tester and Foundation Level Agile Tester. Certified Tester provides the basic knowledge and competencies in software testing. Agile Tester expands on Certified Tester and explains how testing in an agile team is performed.

As Agile Test Leadership at Scale focuses on the organizational level, it supplements the Advanced Level Agile Technical Tester focusing on technical practices. It also supplements Advanced Level Test Management, which focuses on projects and not on organizational aspects. In addition, Advanced Level Test Management covers traditional approaches and hybrid approaches.

## 0.3 Examinable Learning Objectives and Cognitive Level of Knowledge

Learning objectives (LOs) support the business outcomes and are used to create the Advanced Level Agile Test Leadership at Scale exams.

In general, all contents of this syllabus are examinable at a K1 level, except for the Introduction and Appendices. That is, the candidate may be asked to recognize, remember, or recall a keyword or

concept mentioned in any of the chapters. The specific LOs levels are shown at the beginning of each chapter, and classified as follows:

* K1: Remember
* K2: Understand
* K3: Apply
* K4: Analyze

Further details about cognitive level of knowledge are given in [Appendix A](#_bookmark18).

All terms listed as keywords just below chapter headings shall be remembered (K1), even if not explicitly mentioned in the learning objectives.

## 0.4 Hands-On Objectives

LOs and hands-on objectives (HOs) focus on practical skills and competencies. However, HOs are not examined by the multiple-choice exam questions. It is expected that HOs are covered either as part of an accredited training or as self-study.

The specific HOs levels are shown at the beginning of each chapter, and classified as follows:

* H0: This can include a live demo of an exercise or recorded video. Since this is not performed by the trainee, it is not strictly an exercise.
* H1: Guided exercise. The trainees follow a sequence of steps performed by the trainer.
* H2: Exercise with hints. The trainee is given an exercise with relevant hints to enable the exercise to be solved within the given timeframe.
* H3: Unguided exercises without hints.

Training material owners and people who self-study can find additional guidance on how to include practical elements to fulfill HOs in the ATLaS Accreditation Guidelines.

## 0.5 The Advanced Level Agile Test Leadership at Scale Certification Exam

The Agile Test Leadership at Scale certification is created incrementally. Each increment is made available on the ISTQB*®* website so the contents can be used for training and learning. However, the certification exam will be released once the release increments correspond to a two-day training course. Therefore, the detailed description of the certification exam will be added with the last increment.

The Advanced Level Agile Test Leadership at Scale Certificate exam will be based on this syllabus and the Advanced Level Agile Test Leadership at Scale body of knowledge (BOK). Answers to exam questions may require the use of material based on more than one section of this syllabus and body of knowledge. Standards and books are included as references, but their content is not examinable, beyond what is summarized in the syllabus or body of knowledge from such standards and books.

Entry Requirement Note: The ISTQB*®* Foundation Level certificate shall be obtained before taking the Advanced Level Agile Test Leadership at Scale certification exam.  Contact your local member board for more details.

## 0.6 Accreditation

An ISTQB*®* Member Board or its agent may accredit training providers whose course material follows this syllabus and the body of knowledge. Training providers should obtain accreditation guidelines from the Member Board or its agent that performs the accreditation. An accredited course is recognized as conforming to this syllabus and the body of knowledge, and is allowed to have an ISTQB*®* exam as part of the course.

Training providers are encouraged to use the contents of this certification in other contexts and to build the training material incrementally. Feedback from such activities will be considered before the full certification is released.

The accreditation guidelines for Advanced Level Agile Test Leadership at Scale follow the general Accreditation Guidelines published by the Processes Management and Compliance Working Group.

## 0.7 Level of Detail

The level of detail in this syllabus allows internationally consistent courses and exams. In order to achieve this goal, the syllabus consists of:

* *General instructional objectives* describing the intention of the Advanced Level Agile Test Leadership at Scale Level
* *A list of keywords* that students must be able to recall
* LOs for each knowledge area, describing the cognitive learning outcome to be achieved
* A description of the key concepts, including references to sources such as accepted literature or standards

The syllabus content is not a description of the entire knowledge area of testing in agile organizations; it reflects the level of detail to be covered in Advanced Level Agile Test Leadership at Scale training courses.

## 0.8 How this Syllabus is Organized

There are five* chapters with examinable content. The top-level heading for each chapter specifies the time for the chapter; timing is not provided below chapter level*.* For accredited training courses the five chapters require a minimum of 11.5 hours of instruction divided over at least two days. The five chapters are:

* Chapter 1: 60 minutes, Quality Assistance
* Chapter 2: 120 minutes, Improve Quality and Flow in a Value-Driven Organization
* Chapter 3: 150 minutes, Continuous Improvement of Quality and Testing
* Chapter 4: 165 minutes, Organizational Test Strategy in a Value-Driven Organization
* Chapter 5: 195 minutes, Test Process in a Value-Driven Organization

## 0.9 Business Context

Organizations strive to improve their business agility to provide valuable products and services in a changing world. A key way to improve business agility is to transform the culture and mindset by using different principles, frameworks, disciplines, and methodologies such as agile, lean, and DevOps, which we here cover with the term “business agility.” One common principle in these frameworks and disciplines is the focus on delivering value with the quality that customers demand, i.e., customer- focused. Therefore, the term value-driven is used to describe organizations that strive to achieve business agility regardless of their various ways of working.

Agile started as a way to improve how software was delivered iteratively. It focused on a small delivery team that could release software in shorter iterations than the traditional software development lifecycles. As the popularity of the agile methods grew, it became apparent that at times there was a need for several delivery teams to collaborate in order to develop larger and more complex systems (also called a team of agile teams). Therefore, new frameworks were created in order to scale agile from individual

agile delivery teams to multiple delivery teams contributing to the value of the solution. Delivery teams often consist of people from different organizations that work together to provide the overall solution. This move from focusing on individual delivery teams to multiple teams is called “agile at scale” or “scaled agile.” This also requires that testing approaches are scaled.

Scaling agile is not necessarily the same as business agility, which includes the entire enterprise, but in order to achieve business agility an organization could benefit from adopting agile at scale.

With business agility there is an even greater need for accelerated quality. This is not achievable if all responsibility for quality remains in the individual teams or specific roles such as testers. Therefore, test management moves to quality management and organizations need to adopt quality assistance across the organization as well as within delivery teams. This changes the role of quality assurance and test professionals to be closer to agile test leadership and to fostering a quality culture and mindset.

## 0.10 Business Outcome

The business outcome (BO) describes the benefit that a certified person should be able to deliver using the knowledge and competencies covered in the syllabus. The knowledge and competencies are described in the LOs for each chapter.

### 0.10.1 BO 1 Foster a Value-Driven Quality Mindset and Culture
A person who has gained the qualifications in this syllabus can build and sustain a quality and testing culture in a value-driven organization or in an organization transitioning to a value-driven culture.

An example of a measurable key result for the business outcome is:

* Provide quality assistance to x colleagues, who do not have a background in testing or other quality management activities

(replace x with your own target).

### 0.10.2 BO 2 Co-create and implement an organizational test strategy that develops quality and testing capabilities
In a value-driven organization, it is still crucial to have a strategy for building the required quality and testing capabilities to deliver customer and business value. 

Examples of measurable key results for the business outcome are:

* A continuous reduction in lead time for Minimum Viable Products (MVP) or Minimum Marketable Features (MMF)
* ` `time for Minimum Viable Products (MVP) or Minimum Marketable Features (MMF)
* x % improvement in reaching business benefits 
* x % reduction in production incidents or customer complaints (a customer is whoever consumes your product or service)
* x% increase in quality improvement experiments inspired by the organizational test strategy
* x% increase in improvement feedback

### 0.10.3 BO3 Continuously improve test processes addressing challenges in the context of scaled agile product development


# 1 Quality Assistance – 60 minutes

**Keywords**  
Agile test leader, Agile test team leader, Built-in quality, Quality assistance, Quality assurance, Quality coaching, Quality control, Quality management, Test management

**Learning Objectives for Chapter 1:**  

**1.1 What Is Quality Assistance?**  
ATLaS-1.1.1	(K2) Understand quality assistance as an approach to quality and test management

**1.2 Skills for Quality Assistance**  
ATLaS-1.2.1	(K2) Give examples of the change leadership, quality coaching, facilitation, and training skills required for quality assistance

ATLaS-HO-1.2.1	(H2) Given a quality-related problem, provide quality assistance using one or more of the four important skills (change leadership, quality coaching, facilitation, and training)

## 1.1 What is Quality Assistance?
Quality assistance is an approach to quality management that is crucial to developing and sustaining a value-driven organization.

The certification covers how quality assistance as an approach fits with known software testing concepts such as test management, quality control, and quality assurance.

Quality assistance is the approach test management should embrace to help in adopting and fostering a transformation to business agility. A quality assistance approach to test management is significantly different from a traditional mindset and traditional approach (Gartner, 2018). Some important differences are as follows:

*  Optimizes for flow and value delivery
*  Focuses on prevention, automation, and observability
*  Encourages built-in quality practices continuously
*  Supports self-empowered teams by enabling others to take responsibility for quality- and testing-related activities
*  Embeds testing throughout the organization instead of sustaining testing silos
*  Requires agile test leaders and agile test team leaders that serve, rather than test managers that control
*  Has agile test leaders and agile test team leaders helping everyone in the organization collaborate through community of practice events

It is important to understand that test management as a discipline is still needed as part of quality assistance in value-driven organizations.

## 1.2 Skills for Quality Assistance

One of the important aspects of quality assistance is to enable everyone in the organization to contribute to and take a shared responsibility for quality. The certification introduces change leadership, quality coaching, facilitation, and training as important skills for agile test leaders and agile test team leaders to succeed with quality assistance.

Change leadership is crucial to successful organizational change. It is important that quality assistance aligns with the change programs in an organization, especially programs to improve business agility. Change leadership includes human aspects, which affects people’s capacity to deal with change as well as fostering a culture of continuous improvement.

Quality coaching is a skill using a set of activities focused on helping the agile organization deal with quality-related topics. It is a collaborative dialog that promotes reflection in teams or with a single person. Conditions for effective quality coaching are also covered as part of this certification.

Facilitation is a skill in quality assistance that encourages people to use their knowledge and skills to reach a desired outcome. Facilitation is important to engage everyone and to build a shared responsibility for quality.

Training is a skill to help people build their skills. A variety of methods are introduced to cater for different needs and purposes. In order to scale the training it is important to engage the relevant organizational departments that support employees’ skill growth and career development.

Since each of the above skills are disciplines in their own right, it is important to see them as part of a continuous learning pathway. There are other skills that can be used to serve the organization, such as mentoring or consulting, but these are out of scope for this certification.

How to use the four skills is elaborated in future chapters (see syllabus outline in section 0.8, How this Syllabus is Organized).

# 2 Improve Quality and Flow in a Value-Driven Organization – 120 minutes

**Keywords**  
Effectiveness, Efficiency

**Learning Objectives for Chapter 2:**  

**2.1 Facilitate Value Stream Mapping**  
ATLaS-2.1.1	(K2) Understand value stream as a concept

ATLaS-2.1.2	(K3) Apply value stream mapping as an agile test leader to understand and visualize working flows

**2.2 Analyze a Value Stream from a Quality and Testing Perspective**  
ATLaS-2.2.1	(K4) Analyze a value stream to identify waste and other quality and testing issues using basic metrics

## 2.1 Facilitate Value Stream Mapping

Agile test leaders and agile test team leaders will need to be able to facilitate and contribute to value stream mapping (VSM) activities. Their focus is to optimize quality and testing processes to improve flow and realize value for the customers in a more effective and efficient way.

### 2.1.1 What is a Value Stream?
A value stream is a concept that originates in lean. Value streams are groups or collections of

working steps, including the people and systems that they operate, as well as the information and the materials used in the working steps. In value-driven organizations, quality and testing roles help to optimize the whole value stream, not just testing.

There are two typical types of value streams: operational and development. Operational value streams are all the steps and people required to bring a product from order to delivery (Lean Enterprise Institute, 2014). Development value streams take a product from concept to market launch (Lean Enterprise Institute, 2014). Key aspects of value streams are to understand the lean concepts of flow (which resonates with stream) and waste (non-value-adding activities).

### 2.1.2 Value Stream Mapping
Value stream mapping is a technique for visualizing and analyzing the steps in a value stream. Mapping a value stream can give a shared understanding of how, how much, and how fast the value stream

is able to deliver value in order to fulfi  customer demand. This certifi	covers basic visualization techniques, typical steps in value stream mapping, and practical examples where value stream mapping could be used to map the current state of operation (current state map). A current state map can evolve to a desired state (future state map) if fostered by quality management approaches.

It is also important to understand typical challenges when introducing value stream mapping in an organization.

## 2.2 Analyze a Value Stream from a Quality and Testing Perspective

Optimizing a value stream focuses on the flow of value and on quality. Therefore, value stream analysis can be a powerful tool for anyone who takes a quality assistance approach to quality and testing.

## 2.2.1 Metrics for Analyzing a Value Stream
To help analyze value streams, a few basic flow and quality metrics are introduced, such as:

*  Lead time (LT)
*  Wait time (sometimes called delay time)
*  Processing time (PT)
*  Flow efficiency (sometimes called process cycle efficiency or activity ratio)
*  Percent complete and accurate (%C&A)
*  Phase Containment Efficiency (PCE)

These metrics can be visualized in a value stream map. As data collection can be a challenge, it is important to observe the work being done and discuss with the people doing it what quality metrics can be collected.

## 2.2.2 Identify Non-Value-Adding Activities (Waste)
Agile test leaders and agile test team leaders should be able to identify non-value-adding activities, which in lean are categorized as eight different types of waste:

*  Transport
*  Inventory
*  Motion
*  Waiting
*  Overproduction
*  Over-processing
*  Correction
*  Non-utilized talent

Metrics can give a good indication of poor effectiveness and inefficiency and therefore where to look for waste.

Value stream mapping, analysis, and improvement is an iterative process. Value stream mapping relies on learning to see working flows and empowering people to act differently regarding quality issues. Therefore, agile test leaders and agile test team leaders can contribute in many different ways to achieve quality goals.

#	3 Continuous Improvement of Quality and Testing – 150 minutes

**Keywords**  
Root cause analysis, Agile test team lead, Causal loop diagram

**Learning Objectives for Chapter 3:**  
**3.1 Structured Problem-Solving Approach for Testing and Quality Activities**  

ATLaS-3.1.1	(K3) Apply a Plan-Do-Check-Act cycle to address a quality problem  
ATLaS-3.1.2	(K2) Understand how to embed Plan-Do-Check-Act in the organization

**3.2 Systems Thinking and Analysis of Root Causes**  
ATLaS-3.2.1	(K2) Understand how systems thinking and root cause analysis support a quality assistance approach

ATLaS-3.2.2	(K3) Apply causal loop diagram to identify root causes

## 3.1 Structured Problem-Solving Approach for Testing and Quality Activi- ties

Problem-solving in a value-driven organization may need to span multiple agile teams and sometimes even multiple value streams, as discussed in Chapter 2. This requires a problem-solving approach that both aligns with lean and agile practices and takes a holistic view. Therefore, agile test leaders and agile test team leaders need to be able to understand and use theories and techniques from systems thinking to identify root causes in complex environments.

### 3.1.1 Plan-Do-Check-Act Cycle
The Plan-Do-Check-Act (PDCA) cycle is a practical problem-solving and continuous improvement approach created by W. Edwards Deming. A fundamental principle of PDCA is iteration and seeing improvement efforts as experiments.

An agile test leader can foster the opportunities for improvements across agile teams by facilitating PDCA cycles. This usually starts with a gap analysis, e.g., implementing improvements to move toward a future state value stream map.

It is important to understand the benefits of PDCA cycles and to be able to conduct each step. This includes overcoming potential challenges of using PDCA.

There are other variations of PDCA (e.g., Plan-Do-Study-Act), and other improvement models (e.g., IDEAL). These variations are not covered in this certification. See ISTQB Expert Level Improving the Testing Process for more details on test process improvement (ISTQB®, 2011).

### 3.1.2 Embedding PDCA in the Organization
PDCA can be used for local experiments to improve as well as to broader improvement initiatives. Only doing improvements locally will not scale. It is therefore important that learnings and methods are shared in order to foster organizational learning.

Running PDCA in the context of business agility requires opportunities for shared understanding of problems. It can help if teams regularly identify opportunities, align identified opportunities and

potential improvement experiments with other teams, realize improvement experiments, and signpost team findings for other teams (Béndek, 2018).

Based on the agile at scale frameworks, it is important to understand the typical organizational settings for running PDCA cycles for software development and testing.

To succeed with implementing and embedding PDCA in the organization, it is important to address potential challenges such as creating a secure environment where people feel safe to reveal failures. It is also important that people are open to put in place improvements based on shared ideas.

It is part of the management responsibility of an agile test leader to promote such behavior in a value- driven organization, and address root causes if such behavior does not happen.

## 3.2 Systems Thinking and Analysis of Root Causes

Systems thinking and root cause analysis are important disciplines that provide many different techniques to analyze complex problems. An agile test leader needs to participate in and facilitate analysis of complex problems to help the organization grow and optimize its value streams.

### 3.2.1 Systems Thinking
Some of the agile scaling frameworks include systems thinking as one of their key principles,

therefore you need to understand some common characteristics of systems thinking (Stave & Hopper, 2007) and the techniques that can be used (The LeSS Company B.V., no date).

### 3.2.2 Root Causes
When multiple agile teams need to collaborate in order to implement a system or a solution, some

of the quality assurance (QA) and testing activities will span multiple teams and the responsibility for delivering a working solution is shared between the teams. If a single team tries to fix a problem the solution may cause new problems for the other agile teams.

In a value stream, bottlenecks are a root cause for waste. Some typical bottlenecks in development value streams are:

*  Environment creation
*  Code deployment
*  System testing
*  Software architecture

It requires a flexible set of root cause analysis techniques to discover many potentially relevant root causes using systems thinking. If not used, there is a risk of concluding too quickly that there is just one single root cause. A basic root cause analysis technique in lean is “Five Whys.” Causal loop diagram (CLD) is a method that can help if the feedback structure of human interaction or of the technical system needs to be identified.

### 3.2.3 Causal Loop Diagram
The benefit of a CLD is that it can reveal the non-obvious causes and effects and their interconnectedness in a broader system.

A CLD consists of four basic elements: variables; the causal links between variables; a plus or minus sign on the links; and loop markers. There are different notations used in CLDs. This certification covers a basic notation.

To create a CLD it is important to have a group of people with different perspectives of the problem or system at hand. The main steps that are repeated as the discussion evolves are:

#. Define variables.
#. Define causal relationships between variables.
#. Describe what effect one variable has on another.
#. Add other factors that affect the system (e.g., delays and goals).
#. Identify and describe reinforcing and balancing causal loops.
#. Identify possible interventions to resolve the problem.

ATLaS-4.1.1	(K2) Explain practices supporting DevOps and why to include them in the organizational test strategy

ATLaS-4.1.2	(K2) Exemplify how an organizational test strategy is created and implemented in a value-driven organization

ATLaS-4.1.3 	(K3) Implement assessment techniques to validate test practice alignment with business and technical needs.

**4.2 Fit Agile Test Leadership in a Value-Driven Organization**  

ATLaS-4.2.1 	(K4) Analyze how agile test leadership fits in an organization using an agile scaling framework.

## 4.1 Establish an Organizational Test Strategy

### 4.1.1 Important DevOps Practices 
Value-driven organizations use DevOps as an approach to deliver value faster throughout all the steps in its value streams. Hence an organizational test strategy needs to include practices supporting DevOps in order to accelerate the flow in value streams and be more responsive to stakeholder needs in an ever-changing environment. Organizations need to decide on the relative importance of the various practices.

A generic DevOps infinite loop, a common visualization of the development and operations stages, consists of six stages:  operate, monitor, explore, code, integrate and release

DevOps supports trends like shift-right that were not common in either traditional development or test approaches . An organizational test strategy needs to incorporate activities like building relationships across the organization, monitoring, and testing in production. All system environments in DevOps are designed for resilience, which helps enable testing in production.

Additional aspects that help to build quality into the DevOps process include:

Operating in DevOps

* Use of feature toggles
* Automated control and management of test and production environments used during release stage  
* Testing in production
* Canary releases

Monitoring in DevOps  

Exploring in DevOps

* Hypothesis-driven development used for creating a minimum viable product (MVP) during exploration

Coding and integrating in DevOps

Releasing in DevOps

* Self-service environment management
* Blue/green deployment strategy and chaos engineering

For organizations where DevOps is not a mature capability the organizational test strategy should outline improvement goals and how to contribute to higher DevOps maturity.

### 4.1.2 Create and Implement an Organizational Test Strategy
Test strategies exist on different levels: organizational, product and operational . This certification focuses on test strategy on an organizational level.

Value-driven organizations can reuse elements from existing test strategies. Some traditional test strategies like consultative, regression-averse and model-based approaches are particularly relevant and inspiring in this context.

When creating an organizational test strategy, agile test leaders can draw inspiration from the definitions of done (DoD) of agile teams. Similarly, an organizational test strategy may define essential elements that all teams must have in their DoD as a minimum.  

Just like a DoD the organizational test strategy should be a lightweight, user-friendly and a “living” artefact.

An organizational test strategy can be developed and adapted by interested stakeholders collaborating within a communitiy of practice (CoP), especially if the community is topic-based rather than role-based.

Tailoring an organizational test strategy may follow a tailoring-down or a tailoring-up approach.

To avoid the organizational test strategy becoming shelf-ware agile test leaders need to encourage teams to implement experiments in order to validate practices from the organizational test strategy.

In order to involve all interested stakeholders, agile test leaders need to actively lead the implementation using change leadership. One model for leading change on an individual level is called ADKAR

### 4.1.3 Validate Alignment of Test Practices with Business and Technical Needs 
Another important aspect of implementing the organizational test strategy is to be able to assess whether or not it helps the organization to deliver on the organizational business and technical strategy.

In value-driven organizations testing and quality should be embedded in the organization and the assessment of test practices should happen in the context of development and not as a separate area. Quality and testing practices are naturally covered in assessments focusing on DevOps or organizational agility.

An agile test leader can propose to use a suitable maturity model to assess an organization’s capabilities or the competencies of an organizational unit or a single team. A DevOps health radar is an example of a maturity model that also covers quality and testing areas. For more details about maturity models focusing on test process improvement see Expert Level in *Improving the Testing Process* (ISTQB®, 2011)

Assessments on organizational level have several disadvantages that risk disempowering and disengaging the teams responsible for the assessed capabilities. Self-assessments, either facilitated or fully self-managed, are more suitable for a value-driven organization. Which approach to use depends on the organizational scope of the assessment, maturity of the teams and the culture of the organization, especially related to psychological safety.

It is also important to consider what to measure. Maturity models that take a holistic view usually measure three areas: outcomes in terms of business value, outputs in terms of delivery and performance and maturity in terms of people and processes.

Depending on the purpose of the assessment, the method used and the maturity of the organization an assessment can be conducted in different manners. An agile test leader can conduct the typical steps in a facilitated self-assessment which includes planning, conducting and concluding the self-assessment.

## 4.2 Fit Agile Test Leadership in a Value-Driven Organization

### 4.2.1 Organizational, Product and Operational Level
Organizations need certain quality and testing capabilities in order to deliver quality products and services. Agile test leadership has to ensure that the organizational test strategy describing these capabilities is aligned with and supports the business strategy. The agile test leader can also evaluate the current quality and testing capabilities, question ineffective or inefficient practices and facilitate a possible adjustment of the organizational strategy.

On organizational level improvements often go beyond what even teams of agile teams can achieve on their own because they require a coordinated effort and significant funding. The agile test leader can support such large initiatives by providing business stakeholders with a business case to justify investments and metrics to measure success.

In a value-driven organization, budget allocation often includes a broad set of stakeholders with different perspectives. The agile test leader may contribute to this process by analyzing trade-offs related to quality and testing.

On product level the scale is smaller than the entire organization but larger than a single team. Here the agile test leader can:

* be a practice leader within the testing community of practice (CoP)
*  help teams to identify waste using value stream mapping (VSM)
*  guide teams to capture product quality in their definitions of “ready” and “done”
*  teach teams systems thinking to reduce the risk of local optimization
*  facilitate multi-team retrospectives and process improvement
*  help teams with continuous improvement of their quality capabilities
*  provide System QA and testing expertise to agile teams by leading a specialized service group
*  help to find a good balance between decentralized and centralized testing

On operational level, the agile test leader can coach teams of agile teams in test related subjects (testing techniques and tools, metrics, effort estimation, risk-based testing, pairing, peer reviews, test-first practices, design for testability).

The agile test leader can also support teams of agile teams from within a specialized service group providing test related services (refactoring of a test automation framework, integration of tests into CI/CD, management of test infrastructure and tools, end-to-end and non-functional testing)

### 4.2.2 Transition from Traditional Test Management to Agile Test Leadership at Scale
During a transition from “traditional” test management to agile test leadership at scale a test manager will have to assume new responsibilities, uphold some old responsibilities and beware of anti-patterns. 

New responsibilities which arise from an agile test leader role are using value stream mapping and systems thinking, involving various disciplines along the entire value stream and speaking up in case of dysfunctions.

On the organizational level an agile test leader needs to influence strategic decisions such as identifying, establishing and sustaining testing skills and capabilities and allocating budget for funding them and identify practices to be consolidated and centralized in order to create synergies. 

Responsibilities to be continued are empowering agile (test) teams by coaching, offering training, fostering CoPs and suggesting test process improvements, providing guidance on test related topics, representing testing within the organization and being an escalation point for impediments. 

Anti-patterns to be avoided result from any behavior which would undermine the idea of self-organized and responsible agile teams such as a “command and control” type management behavior.

## 5.1 Test Processes 
There are some test processes which are challenging to handle in an agile process. This section covers typical processes and provides suggestions on how to organize them to decrease problems.

### 5.1.1 Testing challenges in scaled agile product development
When scaling the agile product development in a value-driven organization some issues arise that are not present in a classic organization. Some typical challenges are:

* Agile teams cannot test the full solution independently and when responsibility for performing cross-team testing activities becomes ambiguous this can result in testing falling between two chairs. See the section 5.4 for more information. 
* Changing the mindset throughout the organization to allow trained testers to move into early product development when forming hypothesis and exploring user needs
* Determining if certain types of testing should be organized in one or multiple teams and determining when to switch between the two concepts. See section 5.5 for more information. 
* Establishing transparency for stakeholders across self-organized teams using classic test metrics. See the section 5.3 for more information.
* Slicing up test activities to fit them into an iteration and avoid pushing testing efforts forward, resulting in not being able to finish all activities before a release. See the section 5.4 for more information.
* Coordinating and synchronizing testing efforts across agile and non-agile teams both internal and external to enable the delivery of one common solution. See the section 5.2 for more information.

### 5.1.2 Coordinate testing efforts across agile and non-agile teams
If QA and testing are handled as separate activities, it is harder to get a shared understanding and responsibility for them, to identify and minimize dependencies between teams. and for the teams to understand which tasks to pick.   

Coordination of tests between teams can be challenging, particularly if some teams are non-agile, in agile transition or from a third party. The following proven agile practices are examples of how to coordinate testing across agile and non-agile teams. 

* One Backlog / Cross-Team Refinement
* Big room planning (e.g., PI Planning)
* Scrum of Scrums
* Demo of integrated and tested product increments
* Retrospective / Inspect & Adapt
* Impediments and risk boards
* Debt handling / Technical enablers

### 5.1.3 Test and flow related metrics
To understand how well value is delivered across the organization it is necessary to align on a set of metrics. Then all teams across the value stream measure and share the results on a regular basis.

Classic testing metrics focus on test coverage, product quality and effectiveness of testing, but not on the flow of value. Agile test leaders and agile test team leaders should also use other types of metrics that help measure the full value stream. As mentioned in chapter 4, metrics cover three aspects:

* Outcomes in terms of business value.
* Outputs in terms of delivery and performance 
* Maturity in terms of people and processes

Outcomes in terms of business value.

Organizations often focus on the things which increase the value for the organization itself when measuring outcomes in terms of business value. However, cost reductions which increase value for the organization, do not necessarily result in added value for the customers and can decrease value for customers.  If the organization is not ready to define and measure business value it is better to start with delivery and performance metrics.

Outputs in terms of delivery and performance

To help organizations accelerate delivery and performance, there are four key metrics (<https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/devops-sre/using-the-four-keys-to-measure-your-devops-performance>):

* Deployment frequency
* Lead time for changes
* Change failure rate
* Time to restore a service

When selecting which metrics to use it is helpful to think about leading and lagging indicators. The advantage of leading indicators is that they give early feedback. Leading indicators help show if the expected results will be achieved. Lagging indicators measure the actual results. 

Regardless of the types of metrics which the organization starts with it is important that agile test leaders and agile test team leaders focus on the same metrics.

### 5.1.4 Structure challenging test activities and test processes 
Test activities and test processes need to be structured so they fit into scaled agile. Agile Tester (ISTQB Agile Tester), recommends converting test levels into test activities. But that is not enough when scaling.

Structuring test activities

Except for component testing test activities can be difficult to fit into iterations because establishing the infrastructure takes more time and a coordinated effort.

Such test activities can be clustered based on their purpose: 

* Testing functional integration is traditionally done in test levels such as system testing, system integration testing and acceptance testing.
* Testing technical integration is based on architecture design and interface specifications.
  One challenge is to accompany emerging technologies like asynchronous architectures (often called microservices). If microservices were very well encapsulated, agile teams could successfully test technical integration with a big bang approach, because there would hardly be a need for troubleshooting across teams in order to isolate defects. In practice technical integration testing involves quite a bit of troubleshooting which can be harder with asynchronous architectures.
* Testing non-functional quality characteristics such as performance, reliability, security and accessibility

Some of these test activities may be performed outside iterations but agile teams need to retain ownership of and responsibility for testing. Teams should prefer testing within iterations since deferring tests to a separate phase weakens their definition of done. To support the teams handling some of these activities within a sprint, test automation can play an important role.

Handling deployment and release cycles

If deployments and releases are not synchronized between agile teams there will be a wasteful number of extra configurations to be tested. So, all teams should work on the same rhythm and plan together what to implement and collaboratively test in each iteration. To counter the risk that this aligned plan is derailed by delays within individual teams, dependencies between teams should be reduced. Agile test leaders and agile test team leaders should be familiar with common options for reducing dependencies.

Managing organizational risk

Planning risks for cross-team testing should be managed using standard agile procedures. A shared risk board creates visibility and agile practices like big room planning, synchronization meetings and reviews can be used for risk mitigation.

Establishing working agreements with non-agile teams or functions

Value-driven organizations often have non-agile or less agile units.

These units may lack the ability to make frequent deliveries, respond quickly to feedback and to regularly inspect and adapt their processes. So, a successful collaboration will require working agreements

Coordination of agile and non-agile teams has been described in section 5.1.2.

Alignment with vendors, suppliers or partners may be particularly challenging. Agile test leaders can participate in the tender process and help describe the parts of the request for proposal related to quality and testing. 

For existing vendors, suppliers or partners, a strategic initiative may be needed to modify contracts or even choose other vendors, suppliers or partners.

### 5.1.5 Test activities performed by stream-aligned teams and specialized teams 
An agile test leader and agile test team leader need to organize testing activities in different manners depending on the type of activities and the complexity of the solution and organization. Teams can be classified as a stream-aligned, complicated-subsystem, enabling or platform team. How a team is organized impacts on what testing activities the team can do effectively and how it collaborates with other teams. 

Agile test leaders and agile test team leaders must understand how the different types of teams interact and support each other.

Test activities in different types of teams:

Test activities which are typically performed by a stream-aligned team are:

* Traditional testing activities related to feature development
* Hypothesis testing 
* Testing activities due to technological changes on corporate level or general organizational risks

Test activities which are typically performed by a platform team as a service are:

* Services to reduce the number of things which a stream-aligned team needs to handle
* Complex types of testing that affect many teams
* Shared testing tools
* Shared common components for testing purposes

Test activities which are typically performed by a complicated-subsystem team through collaboration are:

* Help with providing special type of testing which is too complicated to be dealt with by a stream-aligned team or platform team. 

Test activities which are typically performed by an enabling team in a consultative manner: 

* Temporary testing activities which often require specialized knowledge and skills which the other teams do not have or have not yet fully mastered
* Research and experiment with new methods and tools for improving testing on behalf of the other teams

Analyzing team structure related to test activities

Depending on the test activity and the knowledge and competencies in the existing teams, different team structures could be useful.  Some of the common aspects to consider are: 

* Non-functional testing
  * Having a platform team or enabling team could be helpful.
* The need for independent testing
  * Not necessarily obtained by formal organizational boundaries
* The structure and complexity of the technical solutions 
  * Platform teams, complicated-subsystem teams and enabling teams may become more relevant
* Collaboration with non-agile teams and functions.
  * One way is to treat them as enabling teams or platform teams.

How to manage testing activities when some of the teams are agile and others are less agile is covered in section 5.1.4. Structure challenging test activities and test processes.
