## 2.1 Facilitate Value Stream Mapping

Agile test leaders and agile test team leaders will need to be able to facilitate and contribute to value stream mapping (VSM) activities. Their focus is to optimize quality and testing processes to improve flow and realize value for the customers in a more effective and efficient way.

### 2.1.1 What is a Value Stream?
A value stream is a concept that originates in lean. Value streams are groups or collections of

working steps, including the people and systems that they operate, as well as the information and the materials used in the working steps. In value-driven organizations, quality and testing roles help to optimize the whole value stream, not just testing.

There are two typical types of value streams: operational and development. Operational value streams are all the steps and people required to bring a product from order to delivery (Lean Enterprise Institute, 2014). Development value streams take a product from concept to market launch (Lean Enterprise Institute, 2014). Key aspects of value streams are to understand the lean concepts of flow (which resonates with stream) and waste (non-value-adding activities).

### 2.1.2 Value Stream Mapping
Value stream mapping is a technique for visualizing and analyzing the steps in a value stream. Mapping a value stream can give a shared understanding of how, how much, and how fast the value stream is able to deliver value in order to fulfill customer demand. This certification	covers basic visualization techniques, typical steps in value stream mapping, and practical examples where value stream mapping could be used to map the current state of operation (current state map). A current state map can evolve to a desired state (future state map) if fostered by quality management approaches.

It is also important to understand typical challenges when introducing value stream mapping in an organization.

## 2.2 Analyze a Value Stream from a Quality and Testing Perspective

Optimizing a value stream focuses on the flow of value and on quality. Therefore, value stream analysis can be a powerful tool for anyone who takes a quality assistance approach to quality and testing.

## 2.2.1 Metrics for Analyzing a Value Stream
To help analyze value streams, a few basic flow and quality metrics are introduced, such as:

*  Lead time (LT)
*  Wait time (sometimes called delay time)
*  Processing time (PT)
*  Flow efficiency (sometimes called process cycle efficiency or activity ratio)
*  Percent complete and accurate (%C&A)
*  Phase Containment Efficiency (PCE)

These metrics can be visualized in a value stream map. As data collection can be a challenge, it is important to observe the work being done and discuss with the people doing it what quality metrics can be collected.

## 2.2.2 Identify Non-Value-Adding Activities (Waste)
Agile test leaders and agile test team leaders should be able to identify non-value-adding activities, which in lean are categorized as eight different types of waste:

*  Transport
*  Inventory
*  Motion
*  Waiting
*  Overproduction
*  Over-processing
*  Correction
*  Non-utilized talent

Metrics can give a good indication of poor effectiveness and inefficiency and therefore where to look for waste.

Value stream mapping, analysis, and improvement is an iterative process. Value stream mapping relies on learning to see working flows and empowering people to act differently regarding quality issues. Therefore, agile test leaders and agile test team leaders can contribute in many different ways to achieve quality goals.
