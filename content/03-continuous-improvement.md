## 3.1 Structured Problem-Solving Approach for Testing and Quality Activities

Problem-solving in a value-driven organization may need to span multiple agile teams and sometimes even multiple value streams, as discussed in Chapter 2. This requires a problem-solving approach that both aligns with lean and agile practices and takes a holistic view. Therefore, agile test leaders and agile test team leaders need to be able to understand and use theories and techniques from systems thinking to identify root causes in complex environments.

### 3.1.1 Plan-Do-Check-Act Cycle
The Plan-Do-Check-Act (PDCA) cycle is a practical problem-solving and continuous improvement approach created by W. Edwards Deming. A fundamental principle of PDCA is iteration and seeing improvement efforts as experiments.

An agile test leader can foster the opportunities for improvements across agile teams by facilitating PDCA cycles. This usually starts with a gap analysis, e.g., implementing improvements to move toward a future state value stream map.

It is important to understand the benefits of PDCA cycles and to be able to conduct each step. This includes overcoming potential challenges of using PDCA.

There are other variations of PDCA (e.g., Plan-Do-Study-Act), and other improvement models (e.g., IDEAL). These variations are not covered in this certification. See ISTQB Expert Level Improving the Testing Process for more details on test process improvement (ISTQB®, 2011).

### 3.1.2 Embedding PDCA in the Organization
PDCA can be used for local experiments to improve as well as to broader improvement initiatives. Only doing improvements locally will not scale. It is therefore important that learnings and methods are shared in order to foster organizational learning.

Running PDCA in the context of business agility requires opportunities for shared understanding of problems. It can help if teams regularly identify opportunities, align identified opportunities and

potential improvement experiments with other teams, realize improvement experiments, and signpost team findings for other teams (Béndek, 2018).

Based on the agile at scale frameworks, it is important to understand the typical organizational settings for running PDCA cycles for software development and testing.

To succeed with implementing and embedding PDCA in the organization, it is important to address potential challenges such as creating a secure environment where people feel safe to reveal failures. It is also important that people are open to put in place improvements based on shared ideas.

It is part of the management responsibility of an agile test leader to promote such behavior in a value- driven organization, and address root causes if such behavior does not happen.

## 3.2 Systems Thinking and Analysis of Root Causes

Systems thinking and root cause analysis are important disciplines that provide many different techniques to analyze complex problems. An agile test leader needs to participate in and facilitate analysis of complex problems to help the organization grow and optimize its value streams.

### 3.2.1 Systems Thinking
Some of the agile scaling frameworks include systems thinking as one of their key principles,

therefore you need to understand some common characteristics of systems thinking (Stave & Hopper, 2007) and the techniques that can be used (The LeSS Company B.V., no date).

### 3.2.2 Root Causes
When multiple agile teams need to collaborate in order to implement a system or a solution, some

of the quality assurance (QA) and testing activities will span multiple teams and the responsibility for delivering a working solution is shared between the teams. If a single team tries to fix a problem the solution may cause new problems for the other agile teams.

In a value stream, bottlenecks are a root cause for waste. Some typical bottlenecks in development value streams are:

*  Environment creation
*  Code deployment
*  System testing
*  Software architecture

It requires a flexible set of root cause analysis techniques to discover many potentially relevant root causes using systems thinking. If not used, there is a risk of concluding too quickly that there is just one single root cause. A basic root cause analysis technique in lean is “Five Whys.” Causal loop diagram (CLD) is a method that can help if the feedback structure of human interaction or of the technical system needs to be identified.

### 3.2.3 Causal Loop Diagram
The benefit of a CLD is that it can reveal the non-obvious causes and effects and their interconnectedness in a broader system.

A CLD consists of four basic elements: variables; the causal links between variables; a plus or minus sign on the links; and loop markers. There are different notations used in CLDs. This certification covers a basic notation.

To create a CLD it is important to have a group of people with different perspectives of the problem or system at hand. The main steps that are repeated as the discussion evolves are:

#. Define variables.
#. Define causal relationships between variables.
#. Describe what effect one variable has on another.
#. Add other factors that affect the system (e.g., delays and goals).
#. Identify and describe reinforcing and balancing causal loops.
#. Identify possible interventions to resolve the problem.
